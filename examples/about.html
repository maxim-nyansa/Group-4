						The estate develops green space, encourages recycling, reuse and standard of maintenance culture.

						The growth in human population with a corresponding yearning for increased standard of living and comfort but at competitive cost continues to engage the attention of service providers and property developers. The one most important opportunity in this challenge is the   over-reliance on the traditional (fossil) sources of energy. Competition for this non-renewable energy resource is on the increase thus endangering sustainable energy development and supply.
						Coupled with this is the current energy price volatility which is only reflective of the inadequate investment in basic renewable energy infrastructure for production, delivery, storage and distribution.<br><br>
